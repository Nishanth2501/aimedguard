# EDA Completion Summary

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Objective:** Become deeply familiar with claims, operational, and compliance datasets

---

## Objectives Completed

### 1. Data Loading & Profiling
- Loaded all raw data into pandas DataFrames
- Sampled large files (1,000 rows from 9.6M claims)
- Extracted and validated all PDF compliance documents

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation
For each dataset, documented:
- Shape (rows √ó columns)
- Complete list of column names
- Data types for all columns
- Summary statistics for numeric columns
- Value counts for key categorical fields
- Sample records (head)

### 3. Data Quality Checks
- Identified null/missing values in each column
- Found obvious outliers and impossible values
- Checked for duplicate records (none found)
- Identified encoding issues ("Not Available" strings)
- Discovered credential standardization needs

### 4. Compliance PDF Validation
- Successfully extracted text from all 9 PDFs
- Verified machine-readability
- Confirmed key compliance terms present
- Validated structure and organization

---

## Key Findings Summary

### Claims Data (9,660,647 records)
- **Structure:** 28 columns, CMS-formatted names
- **Key Issues:** Duplicate credential encoding (M.D. vs MD), address line 2 missing (expected)
- **Insights:** 72% physicians, 95.7% individual providers, high payment variation
- **Quality:** No duplicates, consistent NPI format

### Operational Data (124,434 records)
- **Structure:** 3 files covering state and hospital-level metrics
- **Key Issues:** "Not Available" strings, mixed data types in Score column
- **Insights:** 5,381 hospitals, 56 states, most cluster around national average
- **Quality:** Geographic patterns match population, consistent measure IDs

### Compliance Documents (1,559 pages)
- **Structure:** 9 PDF files, well-organized with TOCs
- **Key Issues:** None - all files validated successfully
- **Insights:** Comprehensive coverage of billing, privacy, claims processing
- **Quality:** All machine-readable, ready for RAG implementation

## Critical Issues Identified

### Priority 1 (Must Fix)
1. **"Not Available" String Encoding**
   - Location: All operational datasets
   - Impact: Prevents numeric analysis
   - Solution: Convert to NaN during ETL

2. **Duplicate Credential Formats**
   - Location: Claims data - Rndrng_Prvdr_Crdntls
   - Impact: Incorrect aggregations
   - Solution: Standardization lookup table

3. **Mixed Data Types in Score Column**
   - Location: Timely_and_Effective_Care-Hospital.csv
   - Impact: Cannot perform numeric operations
   - Solution: Split into numeric_score and categorical_score

### Priority 2 (Should Fix)
4. **CMS Column Naming**
   - Location: Claims data
   - Impact: Readability, maintainability
   - Solution: Apply standardized column mappings

5. **Cross-Dataset Join Keys**
   - Location: Claims (NPI) vs Operational (Facility ID)
   - Impact: Cannot link provider and facility data
   - Solution: Geographic matching or external crosswalk

---

## Statistical Highlights

### Claims Data (from sample)
- **Average submitted charge:** $417.60
- **Average Medicare payment:** $87.05
- **Payment rate:** ~20% of submitted charges
- **Service volume range:** 11 to 34,752 per provider
- **Beneficiaries per combo:** 11 to 3,106

### Operational Data
- **Hospital count:** 5,381 unique facilities
- **State distribution:** TX (456), CA (379), FL (221)
- **Quality measures:** 20 different measure types
- **Performance:** 50.1% show no hospitals worse than average

### Missing Value Patterns
- **Expected high:** Address line 2 (69.2%), Footnotes (43-93%)
- **Unexpected:** "Not Available" strings instead of nulls
- **Correlated:** First name (4.3%) = Organizational entities (4.3%)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. Implement ETL pipelines with data cleaning
2. Address Priority 1 critical issues
3. Create standardized column mappings
4. Build data validation schemas with Pydantic

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
5. Develop feature engineering pipeline
6. Create provider-facility linkage strategy
7. Build initial fraud detection features
8. Set up compliance RAG system

### Medium Term
9. Develop ML models for fraud detection
10. Build quality prediction models
11. Create interactive dashboards
12. Implement API endpoints
